Workflow for Syncing Database (SQLite)

At Home PC (where you made changes):

Go to your Django project folder.

Locate your SQLite file:

db.sqlite3


Copy this file to your USB drive.

At School PC:

Plug in your USB.

Replace the existing db.sqlite3 inside your school Django project folder with the one from your USB.

Now your school project has the updated records.

At School (if you make new changes there):

Do the same in reverse: copy db.sqlite3 from the school project to USB.

Paste/replace it back into your home project folder.

⚠️ Important Notes

Never edit on both computers at the same time without syncing — otherwise one copy will overwrite the other and you’ll lose data.

Always replace the full db.sqlite3 file. Don’t try to merge manually.

You can also copy a backup of db.sqlite3 before replacing, in case you make a mistake.
